h1. RBlog. Yet another Ruby on Rails blog engine

h2. In English

h3. How it all began?

All is easy. After my personal blog www.aleksandrov.me (it was running WordPress) was hacked I understood that I had to run it on Rails.
I searched a lot for good Rails blog engine, then i decided to write my own. That's all.

h3. How to install RBlog?

First you need server with Rails-2.3.4 or later.
Clone RBlog from GitHub

bc .git clone git://github.com/igor-alexandrov/rblog.git

It will make a directory called @rblog@ on your hard disk. Got into it. Now you should prepare your database. Just copy @config/database_sample.yml@ as @config/database.yml@
and edit it in your favorite editor. By the way @wp_db@ in @database.yml@ is a configuration for database with WordPress (this is if you are migrating from wordpress).
So, your @database.yml@ is ready. Now you should create tables in your database.

bc. rake db:migrate

Tables are ready, lets just load some initial data into them.

bc. rake db:seed

Run

bc. ./script/server

That is all, you can see your blog at @localhost:3000@. Admin section is located at @localhost:3000/admin@, default user is "*admin*" and password is "*admin*" too.
Enjoy!

h3. How to migrate from WordPress?

It is easy. RBlog can copy your posts and comments now. For this install RBlog, write appropriate parameters for @wp_db@ in @database.yml@ and then type

bc. rake migrate:from_wordpress

That is all!

h3. Как всё начиналось?

После того как мой персональный блог www.aleksandrov.me (он был на WordPress) взломали какие-то нехорошие люди, я решил перевести его на Rails.
Поискал движок для блога на Rails и решил написать свой. Вот так.
